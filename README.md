Java Internship Tasks
This repository contains the source code for three key tasks completed during my Java internship. Each task showcases different aspects of Java programming, from basic logic and conditionals to object-oriented programming principles.

Task 1: Number Guessing Game
Task 2: Student Grade Calculator
Task 3: Functional ATM Interface

Task 1: Number Guessing Game
In this task, I developed a simple number guessing game in Java. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user must guess the number. The program provides feedback on whether the guessed number is too high or too low, guiding the user toward the correct answer.

Features:
Random number generation.
User input handling.
Feedback mechanism for user guesses.

Task 2: Student Grade Calculator
This task involved creating a student grade calculator that computes the final grade based on a series of scores input by the user. The program applies predefined weightings to the scores and outputs the corresponding letter grade.

Features:
User input handling.
Calculation of weighted averages.
Grade determination based on standard grading scales.

Task 3: Functional ATM Interface
The final task was to develop a basic functional ATM interface. This program simulates basic banking operations such as checking account balance, making deposits, and withdrawing funds.

Features:
Simulated banking transactions (deposit, withdrawal, balance check).
User input validation.
Object-oriented design principles.
Installation and Setup
To run these projects locally, you will need to have Java installed on your machine.
